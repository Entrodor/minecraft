# V0.4.0 - Beta

## Notes

1. Glasential has been removed in this version, in favour for [Crystalix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crystalix). More customizable/can do multiple different glass types in one block.
2. Concurrent Chunk Management Engine has been removed, as it does not play nice with Mahou Tsukai, and potentially other mods/features. Dynamic View is added back.
