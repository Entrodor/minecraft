# V0.5.0 - Beta

## Notes

1. This update replaces Embeddium with Sodium. Ensure "Monocle" is removed/disabled after updating to this version.
    - A 5-20% performance increase was observed on the test environment.
    - If you crash when opening "Video Settings" try to delete/rename your options.txt file.
2. Did a bulk mod update this version, please report any bugs/issues found.
3. Chisels And Bits removed due to causing potential issues with EMI rendering. Replaced with LittleTiles since it works with Sodium.
